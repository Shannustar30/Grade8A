		Patatas bravas is one of the most popular tapas you can order in bars 
		around Spain. As is the case with so many other traditional recipes, the 
		genius lies in the simplicity of the dish. In order to make patatas 
		bravas, all you need to do is cut a few white potatoes into irregular 
		cubes and deep fry them until golden. Then top them with spicy sauce 
		and/or&nbsp;allioli&nbsp;(garlic and olive oil sauce). When done right, the result 
		is nothing short of amazing. That being said, making perfect patatas 
		bravas is an art that not every bar can handle gracefully.</strong></td>
